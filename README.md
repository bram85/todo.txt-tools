todo.txt-tools
==============

This repository contains a few scripts for extending the [todo.txt CLI][1]. It
works on todo.txt files following the [standard format][2].

Additional features include custom sorting, dependencies, recurring tasks,
postponing and easy tag management.

Please note that these tools are **deprecated**.  I have written a todo.txt
application from scratch, called [Topydo][4] that is a merge of the original
todo.txt CLI and these additional tools.
Most of the functionality in this repository has been implemented in Topydo.

Consult the [wiki][3] for more information.
